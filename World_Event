Description of David Ritter and Dennis Glennon's World Event

1) Trigger the event by clicking the mouse on a tile. 

2) The event is creating a 4x4 Lava array around the clicked tile 
(upper left middle corner of 4x4). The lava periodically spawns a "lava monster"
and transforms adjacent blobs to "fire blobs."

3) Any blob that comes close to the lava will turn into a "lava blob" 
that now seeks out a blacksmith to remove it from the world.

4) The new entity, "lava monster," spawns around the lava and seeks out miners. 
When the lava monster is within one square of the miner and the miner doesn't move for
one lava monster movement rate, the miner turns into a lava square (i.e. the miner "dies" 
and turns into lava).
